Plan:

-----------------------
Overall
-----------------------

 - Convert to a Python toolbox
 - Package the whole process into a self-contained, exportable ArcGIS model
 - Add code to provide file structure if it does not exist


-----------------------
splitByDepthExisting
-----------------------

 - Rename to "splitByDepth"
 - Ability to take in shape files OR layers
     - If shape files are passed in it will only take take the "NWGIS.SEWER" only so
       the "NWGIS.SEWER_NO" shape file will not be loaded, and since it is needed later
       in "denseLabels.py", there will have to be an option to load it in by shape there

-----------------------
denseLabels
-----------------------

 - Rename to "generatePoints" since labels are generated later
 - Add a parameter to decide how many metres along the pipe the points are generated
